we have created a simple demo application where at one side we are providing a different input field like brand name, card name, color picker, upload file and submit.
And on other hand we have created a Live card. whatever thing you have updated from this input field it will reflect on other side of the live card. And after hit to the submit button actual card is created by using the redux data...!
